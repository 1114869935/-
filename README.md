# -This is a project that I wrote by myself after watching the machine learning course of bilibili Andrew Ng and the deep learning course of Mu Li after the initial postgraduate exam, according to the tutorials on Zhihu and major websites and e-books. The purpose is to improve my hands-on ability and deepen my understanding of the model I have learned, and at the same time to make up for my shortcomings of cross-examination and lack of undergraduate scientific research experience during the second interview. I hope that I can continue to study for graduate students and continue to learn related knowledge in a deeper and broader way during my graduate studies.
