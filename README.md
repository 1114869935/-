这是我在研究生考试初试结束之后观看B站吴恩达老师的机器学习和李沐老师的深度学习课程之后，根据知乎以及各大网站、电子书籍上的教程自己动手写的项目，目的是为了提高自己的动手能力以及加深自己对于所学模型的理解，同时也是为了复试面试的时候弥补自己跨考以及本科科研经历不足的缺点。希望自己能继续攻读研究生，在研究生期间继续更深更广的学习相关知识
# -This is a project that I wrote by myself after watching the machine learning course of bilibili Andrew Ng and the deep learning course of Mu Li after the initial postgraduate exam, according to the tutorials on Zhihu and major websites and e-books. The purpose is to improve my hands-on ability and deepen my understanding of the model I have learned, and at the same time to make up for my shortcomings of cross-examination and lack of undergraduate scientific research experience during the second interview. I hope that I can continue to study for graduate students and continue to learn related knowledge in a deeper and broader way during my graduate studies.
